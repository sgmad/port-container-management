> A menu-driven console application written in Java for academic purposes.  
> It simulates the operations of a small port by managing **containers** and **ships** using ADTs with Javaâ€™s `ArrayDeque`.

## ðŸ“– Overview

The system models two main entities:

- **Container** - represents cargo with an ID, description, and weight 
- **Ship** - represents an arriving ship with a name and captain

The port works as follows:
- Containers are stored in a stack (LIFO)
- Ships are handled in a queue (FIFO) 
- Loading pairs the next waiting ship with the top container

## âœ¨ Key Features

### 1. ADT Classes
- ðŸ“¦ **Container**: Stores id, description, and weight with formatted `toString()` output  
- ðŸš¢ **Ship**: Stores name and captain with formatted `toString()` output  

### 2. Data Structures
- `ArrayDeque<Container>` â†’ `containerStack` (LIFO: push/pop)  
- `ArrayDeque<Ship>` â†’ `shipQueue` (FIFO: offer/poll)  

### 3. Menu Operations
- [1] Store container (push to stack)  
- [2] View port containers (top to bottom)  
- [3] Register arriving ship (enqueue)  
- [4] View waiting ships (front to rear)  
- [5] Load next ship (pop + poll)  
- [0] Exit  

## ðŸ›  Implementation Highlights

- âœ… Input validation (handles invalid inputs gracefully)  
- ðŸ”„ Proper LIFO/FIFO behavior:  
  - Containers â†’ `push()` / `pop()`  
  - Ships â†’ `offer()` / `poll()`  
- ðŸ–¥ Formatted output matches spec  
- âš  Error handling for empty stacks/queues  

## ðŸš€ Usage Flow

1. Store multiple containers â†’ newest goes on top  
2. Register multiple ships â†’ first arrival is at the front  
3. Load ships â†’ top container goes to front ship  
4. View lists â†’ shows current state  

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters

This program demonstrates practical use of stacks and queues in a real-world-inspired scenario. Itâ€™s a straightforward project for learning:

- ðŸ”’ Encapsulation with classes (`Container`, `Ship`)  
- ðŸ“Š Data abstraction with stacks and queues  
- ðŸŽ› Menu-driven input handling in Java  
- âš™ Basic simulation of logistics operations

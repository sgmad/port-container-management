> A menu-driven console application written in Java for academic purposes.  
> It simulates the operations of a small port by managing **containers** and **ships** using ADTs with Java’s `ArrayDeque`.

## 📖 Overview

The system models two main entities:

- **Container** - represents cargo with an ID, description, and weight 
- **Ship** - represents an arriving ship with a name and captain

The port works as follows:
- Containers are stored in a stack (LIFO)
- Ships are handled in a queue (FIFO) 
- Loading pairs the next waiting ship with the top container

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. ADT Classes
- 📦 **Container**: Stores id, description, and weight with formatted `toString()` output  
- 🚢 **Ship**: Stores name and captain with formatted `toString()` output  

### 2. Data Structures
- `ArrayDeque<Container>` → `containerStack` (LIFO: push/pop)  
- `ArrayDeque<Ship>` → `shipQueue` (FIFO: offer/poll)  

### 3. Menu Operations
- [1] Store container (push to stack)  
- [2] View port containers (top to bottom)  
- [3] Register arriving ship (enqueue)  
- [4] View waiting ships (front to rear)  
- [5] Load next ship (pop + poll)  
- [0] Exit  

## 🛠 Implementation Highlights

- ✅ Input validation (handles invalid inputs gracefully)  
- 🔄 Proper LIFO/FIFO behavior:  
  - Containers → `push()` / `pop()`  
  - Ships → `offer()` / `poll()`  
- 🖥 Formatted output matches spec  
- ⚠ Error handling for empty stacks/queues  

## 🚀 Usage Flow

1. Store multiple containers → newest goes on top  
2. Register multiple ships → first arrival is at the front  
3. Load ships → top container goes to front ship  
4. View lists → shows current state  

## 💡 Why This Matters

This program demonstrates practical use of stacks and queues in a real-world-inspired scenario. It’s a straightforward project for learning:

- 🔒 Encapsulation with classes (`Container`, `Ship`)  
- 📊 Data abstraction with stacks and queues  
- 🎛 Menu-driven input handling in Java  
- ⚙ Basic simulation of logistics operations
